## About

Get To Know Me More is an AI-powered app that allows you to ask AI questions about me to learn more about my personality and professional history. The AI will then respond with relevant information.

## Context

Alan AI is used in this project to answer questions about myself. This is done byÂ including pre-programmed responses to various topics. Furthermore, once the AI sends the current question it believes the user has asked, it opens a modal to help as a visual aid to help the user understand the answer provided by the AI. This project uses React for the front end and GitHub pages to deploy the app.
